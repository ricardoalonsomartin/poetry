Ah distinct I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow
Fromaa my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore
For that rare and radient maiden whom the angels named Lenore

New line here.
